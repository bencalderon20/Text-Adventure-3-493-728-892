This is a short text adventure game that I made, while trying to learn C++.
This being the case, input is limited to between 2 to 5 possible character and all avaiable options will be listed before the user prompt and what actions will be performed.
Any invalid input will have the prompt be repeated until the user enters one of the valid inputs.
----------------------------------||STORY||---------------------------------------------------------
You are an average person named INSERT NAME HERE. Your entire life has been defined by only being able to make one of a small number of choices.
You've done good so far, since you've survived up to this point. Now, it is time for you greatest challenge yet: What will you do today?
Will you travel to a far off land in your head? Will you fight a big burly man? Will you exploit a hamster for internet clout? The possibilities are limited.
So go forth, INSERT NAME HERE. Go forth and conquer!



























































































































































Or don't. That's one of your two options today.
